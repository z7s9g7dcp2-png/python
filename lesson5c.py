# Test 1
# By use of a function that accepts parameters, calculate the simple interest given principal as 45000, rate is 7% and the time taken is 8 years. (si = p*r*t/100)
# Use the same function inside of a loop to calculate two other simple interests. Note use your own principal, rate and time. 

def simple_interest (principal, rate , time):
    simple_interest= (principal * rate * time) /100
    print(f"Principal is {principal}, Rate is  {rate}%, Time is {time} years = Simple Interest: {simple_interest}")

simple_interest(45000,7 , 8)
