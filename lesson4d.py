# While loop
# While loop executes a lock of code repeatedly as long as a certain condition is true.The syntax of a while loop is a follows:
""""
initializing a variable
while keyword,
followed by the condition/statement to be evaluated
followed by a full colon(:),
code to be printed out,
increment/decrement
"""

number = 0
while number < 5:
    print("Hello Leylahni",number)
    number = number + 1


print('==============================')
# create a python program that prints the even numbers from 50 to 70 using while loop

number = 50
while number <= 70:
    print(number)
    number = number + 2

print('==============================')
#Below is a decrement example that prints the multiples of 3 starting from 201 to 150
number = 201
while number>=150:
    print(number)
    number= number - 3

print('==============================')
#elow is an example of an infinite loop.  it is a loop that never ends because the condition is always true.
# number = 1
# while number >0:
#     print(number)
#     number = number + 1
